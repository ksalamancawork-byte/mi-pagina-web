      <h3>Course Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Our Certified Cybersecurity Professional course will prepare you for a career in an industry with 0% unemployment.
        This interactive online course will take you from zero industry experience to a job ready, front line Cybersecurity Analyst in less than six months.
      </p>
      <p>
        The course includes three certifications from CompTIA, certifications which are accredited by the International Organisation for Standardisation and the
        American National Standards Institute (ISO/ANSI). Accreditation is a way of formally recognising certifications that meet a set of quality standards set forth
        by a governing body — meaning that they meet or exceed the global benchmarks set forth by these two governing bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The combination of accreditation and through consultation with our Advisory Board of industry leaders, Lumify Learn ensures that the course prepares you for the latest roles in cybersecurity.
